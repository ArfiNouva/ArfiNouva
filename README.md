## Hi there 👋
My name Is Mochamad Arfi Nouvama (Which is why my Github name Is ArfiNouva), I'm new to github. :D <br>
🔭 I’m currently working on PT. Fattah Tekno Digital as QA Engineer, Pentester (Soon) and also an Frontend Engineer (In Progress) <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning in PHP and Kotlin! <br>
 ♂️  Pronouns: Arfi, Nouva, Fi, Him/He <br>
⚡ Fun fact: I like playing FPS, RPG and Moba Games, but not that much, Sometimes I like to improve my coding skills with learning My Main Language Deeper or Learn a new Language! Oh, And Also I would love to be a Real Programmer Soon! but i have to work hard by reaching new title first that started as a Fullstack Developer. 🤩 <br>
It is Nice To Know You Guys! ⭐
